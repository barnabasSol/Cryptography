**Input Preparation**: Convert each character of your input message to its binary ASCII representation. The ASCII values for 'r', 'i', and 'p' are 114, 105, and 112 respectively. In binary, these are `01110010`, `01101001`, and `01110000`.

**Padding**: The message is padded so that its length is congruent to 448 modulo 512. Padding is always added, even if the message length is already congruent to 448 modulo 512. The padding starts with a `1` bit followed by as many `0` bits as necessary to bring the length of the message up to 448 modulo 512. In our case, the binary representation of "rip" is 24 bits long. So we add a `1` bit, followed by 423 `0` bits, making the total length 448 bits.

**Append Length**: A block of 64 bits is appended to the message. This block contains the length of the original message (before padding) expressed as a 64-bit number. In our case, the original message was 24 bits long. So we append `0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000011000` (24 in binary represented as a 64-bit number).

So, after these three steps, the binary representation of the string "rip" ready for processing by the RIPEMD-160 algorithm would look something like this:

`01110010 01101001 01110000 1 000...000 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000011000`

This binary string is now ready to be processed by the RIPEMD-160 algorithm. The next steps would involve dividing this string into 512-bit blocks and processing each block through a series of mathematical operations.
